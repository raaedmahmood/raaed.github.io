<p>A lot of people risk their lives everyday for freedom and what they believe in. Some of those people die and those who return suffer from psychological issues due to all of the loses that they’ve seen. Their friends and comrades die right infront of their face and they can’t do anything about it except continuing to fight for freedom<br   /><br   /> These soldiers and other public servants deserve to be remembered and honoured hence the day of remembrance</p>
